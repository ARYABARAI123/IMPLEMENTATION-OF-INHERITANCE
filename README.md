# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-INHERITANCE
# Overview
This Java project demonstrates the concept of multiple inheritance through a simple student result system. It consists of classes representing students and their results.

## Classes
1. `Student_part2`: This class represents a student with attributes such as name, roll number, and marks for two subjects. It includes methods to get and set these attributes.

2. `Result_part2`: This class extends the `Student_part2` class and calculates the total marks and average marks of a student based on the marks obtained in two subjects. It includes a method to display the student's name, roll number, total marks, and average marks.

3. `Main_part2`: This class contains the `main` method where an instance of `Result_part2` is created and its `display` method is called to print the student's result.
